This repository contains the homeworks for the Master University course [Concurrent Systems](https://twiki.di.uniroma1.it/twiki/view/TC/WebHome) @ [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home).
# Abstract
The class is focused on the foundational aspects and on the formal/mathematical semantics of concurrent systems. The class is structured in two main parts. The first part describes the main characteristics and the basilar problems of every concurrent system (mutual exclusion, synchronization, atomicity, deadlock/livelock/starvation, ...) and the relative solutions at the implementation level (semaphores, monitors, system primitives, ...). Furthermore, more evolute notions are shown, like: failure detectors, their implementation and their use to obtain wait-free implementations; universal object, consensus object and consensus number; transactional memory, ... The second part of the course describes the preliminary notions of a minimal concurrent language called CCS (execution of parallel processes through labelled transition systems, interleaving semantics, syntonization, non-determinism, process simulability) and presents a mathematical model, with different features for the specification and the analysis of systems written in such a language.
# Disclaimer
The homeworks have to be taken with a pinch of salt, these are not **solutions but just my final outcomes**.
